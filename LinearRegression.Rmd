# Linear Regression in R

## Create a dataset
```{r}
mouse.data <- data.frame(
  weight = c(0.9, 1.8, 2.4, 3.5, 3.9, 4.4, 5.1, 5.6, 6.3),
  size = c(1.4,2.6, 1.0, 3.7, 5.5, 3.2, 3.0, 4.9, 6.3)
)
mouse.data
```
```{r}
plot(mouse.data$weight, mouse.data$size)
```

## Generate the regression

`lm()` is used to fit linear models. It takes a formula and a dataset as required parameters. A line is `y = mx + c`. Below we set `weight` equal to `y` and `size` equal to `x`

```{r}
mouse.regression <- lm(size ~ weight, data = mouse.data)
summary(mouse.regression)
```
- **Residuals**: Summary of residuals (distance from data to fitted line). Ideally they should be symmetrically distributed about the line
- **Coefficients**: Estimate gives the slope and intercept for the fitted lined. Std. Error and t-value give information as to how the p-values are calculated.The final column gives the p-values, of which the slope is the important one and should be less than 0.05
- **Signif. codes**: Provides a 'legend' for the mark after the p-value.In this case the * shows that the value is below 0.05. 
- **Residual standard error**: The square root of the denominator in the formula for **F**
- **Multiple R-squared**: This is $R^2$, in this case showing that 61% of variation in size is based on weight
- **Adjusted R-squared**: $R^2$ scaled by the number of parameters in the model
- **F-statistic**: The value for $F$ and the degrees of freedom
- **p-value**: p-value
```{r}
plot(mouse.data$weight, mouse.data$size)
abline(mouse.regression, col = 'blue')
```
