# Multiple Regression

Comparing multiple regression to single regression can identify whether the additional parameter(s) are important

## Create the data
```{r}
mouse.data <- data.frame(
  weight = c(0.9, 1.8, 2.4, 3.5, 3.9, 4.4, 5.1, 5.6, 6.3),
  size = c(1.4,2.6, 1.0, 3.7, 5.5, 3.2, 3.0, 4.9, 6.3),
  tail = c(0.7, 1.3, 0.7, 2.0, 3.6, 3.0, 2.9, 3.9, 4.0)
)
mouse.data
```
Consider a simple regression comparing weight and size
```{r}
plot(mouse.data$weight, mouse.data$size)
```
## Simple Regression

There is an apparent relationship, so do a simple regression
```{r}
simple.regression <- lm(size ~ weight, data = mouse.data)
summary(simple.regression)
```
The adjusted R-squred value is only useful in multple regression
In this case the $R^2$ and p-value suggest weight is a useful predictor of size

```{r}
plot(mouse.data$weight, mouse.data$size)
abline(simple.regression, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

## Multiple Regression
```{r}
plot(mouse.data)
```
By not specifying x and y axes `plot()` generates a plot for each possible pair. This suggest that weight and tail are good predictors of size. It also suggests a strong relationship between weight and tail.

Because of the strong correlation between weight and tail we might not need both since they may provide similar information

Note the difference between C1R2 and C2R1. They display the same 
relationship but with the axes switched
```{r}
multiple.regression <- lm(size ~ weight + tail, data = mouse.data)
summary(multiple.regression)
```
$R^2$ and p-values look good. Now that we are using multiple variables 
we should use the Adjusted R-squared value.

In this case the **Coefficients** section is more interesting
weight, eg. shows a comparison between the multiple regression and a simple regression only using tail. The high p-value suggests that adding weight does not significantly improve our results.
Tail compares the multiple regression to a simple regression only using weight. This result suggests that adding tail significantly improves predictions.
So while the multiple regression is better, the addition of weight may not be worth the trouble and cost.
